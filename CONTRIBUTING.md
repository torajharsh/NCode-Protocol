# Contributing to NCode

The project is currently in the **Inception Phase**. I welcome contributions from scientists, researchers and architects.

## Research Tracks
1. **Mathematical Formalization:** Help define the primitives for Additive Latent Synthesis and other components of the Neural Network. <br>
2. **Weight-Latent Synchronization:** Ensuring the correct LoRA batch is active for the corresponding latent stream. <br>
3. **Semantic Integrity:** Propose "Visual Fingerprint" hashes for Semantic Checksum. <br>
4. **Deterministic Integrity:** Carrying the mathematical constants required to prevent visual drift, blending weights and smoothly transiting LoRA adapters with cross-fade for clean transitions. <br>
5. **Edge Infrastructure:** Logic for JIT weight-swapping, VRAM management. <br>
6. **Encapsulation:** A custom container encapsulates the weight fragments and latent deltas into a single, seekable stream. This allows for "Neural Seeking", where the player can jump to any point in the timeline by instantly loading the associated Global Asset IDs and local Weight Fragments.

## How to Help
* **Open an Issue:** Use `[RESEARCH]` or `[PROPOSAL]` tags.
* **Submit a Fragment:** LaTeX additions to the core whitepaper and formal submissions.

**Contact:** Reach out to me via e-mail for any inquiries or any conversation.
